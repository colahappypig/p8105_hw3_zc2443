## Question 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")

str(instacart) #take a brief view of the dataset
```

The `instacart` dataset contains 15 variables and 1384617 observations.
There are 11 numeric variables and 4 character variables. The dataset
records data of rading information for some commodities. Some of the key
variables are product id, order number, reordered, days since prior
order and aisle\_id. For example, 4 product with id 49302 in aisle with
id 120 is purchased and has ever been repurchased. The last time that
this product got purchased was 9 days ago.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% #find the number of ordered items for each aisle
  arrange(desc(n_obs)) 
```

There are 134 aisles. The most items are ordered from fresh vegetables
asile.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  filter(n_obs > 10000) %>% #filter to get aisles with 10000+ ordered items
  arrange(aisle) %>% #arrange by aisle names alphabetically
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n_obs)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + #use bar plot
  theme_classic() + #change the theme
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + #rotate the labels of x-axis to 45 degrees
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(10000,160000,5000)) + #set the break points on y-axis
  labs(x = "Aisle names", y = "Number of items ordered") #name x-axis and y-axis
```
